## About
This R package contains functions for downloading and munging data from the [North American Breeding Bird Survey](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/) (BBS) [via FTP](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/BBS/RawData/) [@pardieck2018north; @sauer2017first]. This package was created to allow the user to bulk-download the BBS point count and related (e.g., route-level conditions) via FTP, and to quickly subset the data by taxonomic classifications and/or geographical locations. This package also maintains data containing the trend and annual indices from the most recent (1996-2017) [hierarhchical popultion trend analyses](https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/) [@sauer2017north]. 

## Quick Start
### Installing __bbsAssistant__
Install the development version of this package using devtools and load the package and dependencies:
```{r install, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("trashbirdecology/bbsAssistant", 
                         dependencies = TRUE, force=FALSE)
library(bbsAssistant)
```

## Quick-download and import
Quickly retrieve all or a subset (states/regions) of the BBS data using the wrapper function, `quick_get_bbs()`:
```{r quick-get-bbs, eval=FALSE}
bbs<- bbsAssistant::quick_get_bbs(state.names = c("Florida", "Nebraska"),  # get only two states for convenience. Leave blank to retrieve all states/regions.
                     overwrite.bbs = FALSE, overwrite.routes = FALSE,  # overwrite routes.csv and bbs data = FALSE
                     get.conditions = TRUE, overwrite.conditions = FALSE) # get weather conditions, does not overwrite

```
