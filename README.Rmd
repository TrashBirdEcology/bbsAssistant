## About

This package contains functions for downloading and munging data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) FTP server [@pardieck2018north; @sauer2017first]. Although the FTP server provides a public interface for retrieving data and analysis results, this package consolidates the efforts of the data user by automating downloading and decompression of .zip data files, downloading route-level information, and saving them as .feather files for speedy import from disk. The data subsetting features of this package also allow the user to readily import and save to file only the data necessary for her purposes. Although the primary audience is for those wishing to use BBS data in Program R for visualization or analysis, this package can be used to quickly download the BBS data to file for use elsewhere. 

## Installing `bbsAssistant`
Install the development version of this package using devtools and load the package and dependencies:
```{r install, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("trashbirdecology/bbsAssistant", 
                         dependencies = TRUE, force=TRUE)
library(bbsAssistant)
```

## Quick Start
Quickly retrieve all or a subset (of states/regions) of the BBS data using the wrapper function, ``bbsAssistant::quick_get_bbs()`:
```{r quick-get-bbs}
bbs <- quick_get_bbs(state.names = c("Florida", "Nebraska"),  # get only two states for convenience. Leave blank to retrieve all states/regions.
                     overwrite.bbs = FALSE, overwrite.routes = FALSE,  # overwrite routes.csv and bbs data = FALSE
                     get.conditions = TRUE, overwrite.conditions = FALSE) # get weather conditions, does not overwrite
```

## Function Descriptions and Vignettes
For function descriptions please build the manual (`devtools::build_manual("bbsAssistant)`) and for an example build the vignette (`devtools::build_vignettes()`; or run `/vignettes/vignettes.Rmd`).
