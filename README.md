## About
**In development.**

This package will host helper functions aimed to automate the downloading and munging of data and metadata from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. 

I currently have a variety of functions spread across some of my existing packages, and plan to incorporate those in this package (see [Issues](https://github.com/TrashBirdEcology/bbsAssistant/issues)) and invite issues or contributions for additional features.

## Contributions
If you would like to contribute, please submit a pr or email me (jessicaleighburnett at gmail). I am especially interested in having another set of eyes and hands to transfer and clean up the functions listed in [Issue 1](https://github.com/TrashBirdEcology/bbsAssistant/issues/1).
