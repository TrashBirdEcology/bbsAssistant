## About
__In development. __

This package will host helper functions aimed to automate the downloading and munging of data and metadata from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. 

## Contributions
I currently have a variety of functions spread across some of my existing packages, and plan to incorporate those in this package (see [Issues](https://github.com/TrashBirdEcology/bbsAssistant/issues), however, am open to adding additional functions. 

If you woudl like to contribute to the package, please email me (jessicaleighburnett at gmail).
